            <h4>Hardware Encryption using FPGA for Image security</h4>
            <h3>July 2021- Present</h3>
            <p>The aim is to design a synthesizable Hardware for encryption and decryption of digital image for image security. A combination of zigzag scan, 
                Fisher-yates shuffle and chaotic mapping is used. The HDL used for design is Verilog.</p>

            <h4>Precision Agriculture using IoT (IIIT-Hyderbad)</h4>
            <h3>May 2021- July 2021</h3>
            <p>The growing population has led to a rise in food demand over the years, a
recent article from Harvard Business Review has stated that the food demand is
expected to increase anywhere between 59% to 98% by 2050. Precision
agriculture will play a very important role in the upcoming years in meeting the
increased demand. This project with the help of Smart sensors, IoT
Infrastructure, and modern machine learning algorithms can help us cope up
with this demand surge. Similar to how humans communicate using sound,
plants communicate with each other by the release of VOCs (Volatile Organic
Compounds). The new trailblazing sensor technology has made it possible for us
to detect these VOCs released by the plant under different stress conditions
(lack of water, light, High temperature). This data paired with Machine learning
can be used to communicate with plants and understand their needs (water,
light, space, CO2 ppm etc). Hence resulting in more efficient use of available
resources and increased yield.</p>

            <h4>VKAT-VON KARMAN AEROELASTIC TURBINE</h4>
            <h3>Jan 2021- Mar 2021</h3>
            <p>Renewable energy is expected to make up 30 percent of the world's energy by 2024, according 
                to the International Energy Agency, and most of this is driven by solar and wind projects that 
                continue to be rolled out at a startling pace. This is where VKAT 
                a energy harvester from low speed wind comes in. VKAT is a system 
                that can harvest energy from vortex induced vibration (Analysis, Simulations, Design and Construction).</p>
